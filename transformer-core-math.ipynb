        "# Transformer Core Math Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT, as well as other LLMs and LMMs are an amazing advance in AI.  But, how do they work?  They all use an ML model called a transformer.  Transformers allow AI to learn the complex relationships between tokens in the training data, in other words to learn the semantics, grammar, and even underlying knowledge encoded in natural language and images.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will focus on the core math that makes a transformer block work, using multi headed attention as well as position and token embedding.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Both the descriptive explanations and the code samples for this tutorial were generated by chatGPT. In some cases the initial code had minor errors, these errors were also fixed by GPT 4 by feeding the errors back into GPT 4 and GPT 4 would generate new code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an advanced tutorial which builds the main components of the Transformer model, the multi headed attention mechanism and the position and token embedding, from scratch in PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Try using the following prompt to generate your own transformer tutorial.  There is alot of code to output and GPT can easily lose attention if the response is too long, so you may need to break the prompt up into smaller bits.  You can also ask followup questions to get it to explain how the code works.  Start with this prompt, and go from there:\n",

It contains 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0) based on the sentiment expressed in the review. The dataset is divided into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing.\n",

This encoding allows for faster processing and less memory usage compared to working with raw text data.\n",

        "### Token Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "The concepts of token embeddings and position embeddings play crucial roles in processing sequential data like text. Let's explore each of these components:\n",
        "\n",
        "Token embeddings convert each token (like a word in a sentence) into a vector of fixed size. This vector representation captures the semantic information of the token, enabling the model to understand and process language.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, each unique token in the vocabulary is assigned a corresponding vector. These vectors are learned during the training process and are adjusted to encapsulate the meanings and relationships of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a transformer model uses only token embeddings, it would be able to understand the meaning of each word but not the order in which they appear. Language is inherently sequential, and the order of words affects the overall meaning of a sentence. Without position information, sentences with the same words in different orders would appear identical to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Position Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Position embeddings are added to the model to give it an understanding of the order or position of words in a sequence. This is crucial for understanding the structure and meaning of sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Position embeddings are vectors that represent the position of each token in the sequence. These vectors are either learned during training or are predefined and based on mathematical functions (like sine and cosine functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "When combined with token embeddings, the model not only understands the meaning of each word but also the context provided by their order in the sentence. This combination allows the transformer to process sentences effectively, recognizing patterns and relationships that depend on the sequence of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Difference Between Token Embedding with and without Position Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Without position embeddings, the model loses the sequential context. It cannot differentiate between \"The cat sat on the mat\" and \"The mat sat on the cat,\" which have vastly different meanings.\n",
        "Handling of Sequential Data: Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, and position embeddings are crucial for maintaining the sequence information. Without position embeddings, transformers would be limited in their ability to process language effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In tasks like translation, question-answering, and text generation, understanding the order of words is essential. Position embeddings significantly enhance the transformer's performance in these tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "While token embeddings provide meaning to individual words, position embeddings give the model an understanding of the order of those words, which is crucial for most language processing tasks. The combination of both allows transformers to effectively interpret and generate human language.\n"

Each input vector contains a vector of 200 tokens, which makes the tensor shape for `input_tokens` (16, 200).  When loaded from the IMDB database, each token represents a single word form the IMDB review, so that `input_tokens` will contain the tokens for one batch of review from the dataset.  You can see the actual tokens for a sample from the IMDB data set in the output below.\n",

        "\n",

        "### Queries (Q), Keys (K), and Values (V)\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Keys (K):**\n",
        "Represent all words (or tokens) in the input sequence. The model uses them to determine how much focus or 'attention' each word in the sequence should get in relation to the current query word.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### How They Work:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the self-attention mechanism, each word in the input sequence is initially transformed into Q, K, and V vectors through distinct linear transformations (learnable weights).\n",
        "The model calculates the attention scores by performing a dot product of the Q vector with all K vectors. These scores determine how much each word in the sequence should contribute to the representation of the current word.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Difference from a Densely Connected Layer:\n",
        "\n",
        "A densely connected layer learns a fixed transformation of its input data, applying the same transformation to all inputs. In contrast, the self-attention mechanism dynamically calculates how much each part of the input should contribute to the output based on the input data itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "The self-attention mechanism can capture relationships and dependencies between words in a sequence, regardless of their distance from each other. A densely connected layer lacks this contextual awareness and processes each input independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence differently for each output element, enabling a more nuanced and context-aware processing. Densely connected layers don't offer this level of flexibility as they apply the same transformation to all inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "In a multi-head self-attention function, Queries, Keys, and Values are used to dynamically compute how different parts of the input sequence should be emphasized or 'attended to' for each element in the sequence. This differs from a simple densely connected layer, which lacks the ability to capture sequential and contextual relationships within the input data. Self-attention is inherently more flexible and context-aware, making it well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, like natural language processing."

By splitting the attention mechanism into multiple heads, the model can capture a richer variety of features in the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each head in the multi-head attention can potentially focus on different aspects of the input data, allowing for parallel and diverse feature extraction. This leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How split_heads Works\n",
        "1. **Input to the Function:**\n",
        "    - The function typically takes the matrices Queries, Keys, and Values as inputs. Each of these matrices is the result of transforming the input sequence through different linear layers specific for Queries, Keys, and Values.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reshaping the Matrices:**\n",
        "    - The `split_heads` function reshapes each of Queries, Keys, and Values matrices from their original shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension]` to a new shape `[batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, feature_dimension/num_heads]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - This reshaping effectively splits the last dimension (feature_dimension) into two dimensions: the number of heads (num_heads) and the reduced feature dimension for each head.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Parallel Attention Processing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - After splitting, each head processes a slice of the original feature dimension, allowing the model to attend to different parts of the feature space independently and in parallel.\n",
        "    - This parallel processing enables the model to capture different types of relationships in the data, such as different aspects of semantic meaning in a language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Recombination and Output:**\n",
        "    - Once each head has processed its respective slice, the outputs are typically concatenated back together and passed through another linear layer to combine the information from all heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - This recombination ensures that the multi-head attention captures a wide range of information from the input while still being able to integrate these diverse signals.\n",

        "The split_heads function in a Transformer's multi-head self-attention mechanism plays a crucial role in diversifying the attention process. By splitting the Queries, Keys, and Values matrices into multiple heads, the Transformer can process the input data in parallel across different feature subspaces, enhancing its ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. This functionality is fundamental to the Transformer architecture's success in various tasks like language understanding, translation, and generation."

        "### Purpose of `combine_heads`\n",
        "1. **Aggregating Outputs from Multiple Heads:** The main purpose of `combine_heads` is to merge the outputs from each of the attention heads.

        "1. **Calculating Dot Products of Queries and Keys:**\n",
        "The function starts by computing the dot product between each query and all keys. This operation essentially measures the similarity or compatibility between each query and key pair.\n",
        "The resulting matrix of dot products has a shape `[sequence_length, sequence_length]`, representing attention scores for each pair of tokens in the sequence.\n",
        "1. **Scaling the Dot Products:**\n",
        "The dot products are scaled down by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors. This scaling is done to prevent the softmax function (applied in the next step) from having a too-small gradient, which can happen when the dot products are large.

        "1. **Multiplying with the Values:**\n",
        "The attention weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors. This step effectively selects or highlights the information in the values based on the computed attention weights.\n",
        "The output is a new set of vectors, each representing a token in the sequence, reweighted to include information from other relevant tokens.\n",
        "1. **Output of the Function:**\n",

        "The `scaled_dot_product_attention` function is at the heart of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. It enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence in a context-sensitive manner. By calculating attention weights and applying them to the values, this function produces output vectors that are contextualized representations of each input token, taking into account the entire sequence. This sophisticated attention mechanism is a key reason for the effectiveness of Transformers in tasks that require an understanding of the entire context, such as natural language processing and sequence modeling."
