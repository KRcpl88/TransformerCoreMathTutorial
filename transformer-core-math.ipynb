        "GPT, as well as other LLMs and LMMs are an amazing advance in AI.  But, how do they work?  They all use an ML model called a transformer.  Transformers allow AI to learn the complex relationships between tokens in the training data, in other words to learn the semantics, grammar, and even underlying knowledge encoded in natural language and images.  \n",

        "\n",
        "The concepts of token embeddings and position embeddings play crucial roles in processing sequential data like text. Let's explore each of these components:\n",
        "\n",
        "Token embeddings convert each token (like a word in a sentence) into a vector of fixed size. This vector representation captures the semantic information of the token, enabling the model to understand and process language.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, each unique token in the vocabulary is assigned a corresponding vector. These vectors are learned during the training process and are adjusted to encapsulate the meanings and relationships of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a transformer model uses only token embeddings, it would be able to understand the meaning of each word but not the order in which they appear. Language is inherently sequential, and the order of words affects the overall meaning of a sentence. Without position information, sentences with the same words in different orders would appear identical to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Position Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Position embeddings are added to the model to give it an understanding of the order or position of words in a sequence. This is crucial for understanding the structure and meaning of sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Position embeddings are vectors that represent the position of each token in the sequence. These vectors are either learned during training or are predefined and based on mathematical functions (like sine and cosine functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "When combined with token embeddings, the model not only understands the meaning of each word but also the context provided by their order in the sentence. This combination allows the transformer to process sentences effectively, recognizing patterns and relationships that depend on the sequence of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Difference Between Token Embedding with and without Position Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Without position embeddings, the model loses the sequential context. It cannot differentiate between \"The cat sat on the mat\" and \"The mat sat on the cat,\" which have vastly different meanings.\n",
        "Handling of Sequential Data: Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, and position embeddings are crucial for maintaining the sequence information. Without position embeddings, transformers would be limited in their ability to process language effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In tasks like translation, question-answering, and text generation, understanding the order of words is essential. Position embeddings significantly enhance the transformer's performance in these tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "While token embeddings provide meaning to individual words, position embeddings give the model an understanding of the order of those words, which is crucial for most language processing tasks. The combination of both allows transformers to effectively interpret and generate human language.\n"

Each input vector contains a vector of 200 tokens, which makes the tensor shape for `input_tokens` (16, 200).  When loaded from the IMDB database, each token represents a single word form the IMDB review, so that `input_tokens` will contain the tokens for one batch of review from the dataset.  You can see the actual tokens for a sample from the IMDB data set in the output below.\n",

        "## Why do we add `token_embeds + position_embeds` instead of concatenating them into a combined vector?\n",
        "Using a sum to combine the elements of both `token_embeds` and `position_embeds` combines the two embeddings in a way where each element of the embedding vector can not distinguish between the position and token embedding individually.  an alternative would be to concatenate the vectors, so that the first 64 elements would be just the position embedding and the next 64 would be the token embedding.  There are several reasons why in most transformer models the position and token embeddings are combined in this way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Learning Dynamics\n",
        "**Interplay of Information:** Adding position and token embeddings allows the model to blend positional information with the semantic content of each token directly. This interplay is crucial for the model to learn the significance of token positions relative to their semantic content within the sequence. It's believed that this combined representation helps the model better learn contextual relationships between tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sufficient for Discrimination:** Despite the apparent risk of losing the distinctiveness of token and positional information when they are added together, in practice, transformer models are still able to effectively learn and distinguish the necessary information for tasks like language understanding and generation. The transformer's attention mechanism, which is highly flexible and capable of modeling complex dependencies, plays a crucial role here.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Theoretical and Empirical Justification\n",
        "**Empirical Success:** The effectiveness of adding position and token embeddings has been empirically validated by the success of transformer models across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. These models have shown remarkable performance in understanding context, sequence relationships, and the nuances of language, indicating that the combined embeddings effectively convey necessary information to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theoretical Flexibility:** The transformer architecture, particularly its attention mechanism, is designed to weigh and interpret the input embeddings dynamically. This means that even though the embeddings are summed, the model can still learn to attend to the aspects of the embeddings (whether they relate more to position or token information) that are most relevant for the task at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "While adding the embeddings might seem to obscure the distinction between token and positional information, the transformer model's design and its capacity to learn complex representations ensure that it can still effectively utilize both types of information. The choice to sum embeddings is thus a balance between maintaining efficient computation, preserving dimensionality, and ensuring that the model can learn and leverage the blended information effectively."

        "### Purpose of `split_heads`\n",
        "The primary purpose of `split_heads` is to enable the model to simultaneously attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. By splitting the attention mechanism into multiple heads, the model can capture a richer variety of features in the input data.\n",

        "1. **Parallel Attention Processing:**\n",
