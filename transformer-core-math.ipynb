        "# Transformer Core Math Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT, as well as other LLMs and LMMs are an amazing advance in AI.  But, how do they work?  They all use an ML model called a transformer.  Transformers allow AI to learn the complex relationships between tokens in the training data, in other words to learn the semantics, grammar, and even underlying knowledge encoded in natural language and images.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will focus on the core math that makes a transformer block work, using multi headed attention as well as position and token embedding.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Both the descriptive explanations and the code samples for this tutorial were generated by chatGPT. In some cases the initial code had minor errors, these errors were also fixed by GPT 4 by feeding the errors back into GPT 4 and GPT 4 would generate new code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an advanced tutorial which builds the main components of the Transformer model, the multi headed attention mechanism and the position and token embedding, from scratch in PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Try using the following prompt to generate your own transformer tutorial.  There is alot of code to output and GPT can easily lose attention if the response is too long, so you may need to break the prompt up into smaller bits.  You can also ask followup questions to get it to explain how the code works.  Start with this prompt, and go from there:\n",

        "### Token Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "The concepts of token embeddings and position embeddings play crucial roles in processing sequential data like text. Let's explore each of these components:\n",
        "\n",
        "Token embeddings convert each token (like a word in a sentence) into a vector of fixed size. This vector representation captures the semantic information of the token, enabling the model to understand and process language.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, each unique token in the vocabulary is assigned a corresponding vector. These vectors are learned during the training process and are adjusted to encapsulate the meanings and relationships of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a transformer model uses only token embeddings, it would be able to understand the meaning of each word but not the order in which they appear. Language is inherently sequential, and the order of words affects the overall meaning of a sentence. Without position information, sentences with the same words in different orders would appear identical to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Position Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Position embeddings are added to the model to give it an understanding of the order or position of words in a sequence. This is crucial for understanding the structure and meaning of sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Position embeddings are vectors that represent the position of each token in the sequence. These vectors are either learned during training or are predefined and based on mathematical functions (like sine and cosine functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "When combined with token embeddings, the model not only understands the meaning of each word but also the context provided by their order in the sentence. This combination allows the transformer to process sentences effectively, recognizing patterns and relationships that depend on the sequence of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Difference Between Token Embedding with and without Position Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Without position embeddings, the model loses the sequential context. It cannot differentiate between \"The cat sat on the mat\" and \"The mat sat on the cat,\" which have vastly different meanings.\n",
        "Handling of Sequential Data: Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, and position embeddings are crucial for maintaining the sequence information. Without position embeddings, transformers would be limited in their ability to process language effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In tasks like translation, question-answering, and text generation, understanding the order of words is essential. Position embeddings significantly enhance the transformer's performance in these tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "While token embeddings provide meaning to individual words, position embeddings give the model an understanding of the order of those words, which is crucial for most language processing tasks. The combination of both allows transformers to effectively interpret and generate human language.\n"

        "### Purpose of `split_heads`\n",

By splitting the attention mechanism into multiple heads, the model can capture a richer variety of features in the input data.\n",

        "1. **Parallel Attention Processing:**\n",

        "1. **Scaling the Dot Products:**\n",

        "1. **Multiplying with the Values:**\n",

By calculating attention weights and applying them to the values, this function produces output vectors that are contextualized representations of each input token, taking into account the entire sequence.
